# KStom
Kotlin standard libraries for Minestom

Check out the [Features](./FEATURES.md) or the demo for some of the utilities KStom has to offer.

## Include in your project

We use [JitPack](https://jitpack.io/#Project-Cepi/KStom) as a repository.

To include this in your project, simply do:

```kotlin
// "Tag" is the commit number in the JitPack link.
implementation('com.github.Project-Cepi:KStom:Tag')
```

## Why kotlin?

DSLs are awesome! Combine that with Minestom's APIs, and it can be extremely seamless
to create the things you need! Check out the [Features](./FEATURES.md) for more information.
